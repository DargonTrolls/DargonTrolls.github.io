                <h1>Rotoscope</h1>
                <p><span>I found that my rotoscope project was one of the most varied projects that i did. The rotoscope i did on a trian i felt was done well and i felt that was done to the best of my ability. on the other hand i felt that my finish rotoscope was rather lackluster. this is due to me motion tweening too much of the finished project.</span></p>

                <h1>Joint animation</h1>
                <p>I felt that i did okay in this project however i also feel that my end result didnt have a large amount of inventiveness as i put a small amount a of unique twist on my final outcome. this project was done in adobe afteraffects using the puppet pin tool. unfortunatly i had forgotten to add a background to my project so it looks rather bad. however i feel that the actual animation was acceptable although not good or realistic.</p>
