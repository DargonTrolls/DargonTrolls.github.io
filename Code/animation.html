                <p><span>I found that my rotoscope project was one of the most varied projects that i did. The rotoscope i did on a trian i felt was done well and i felt that was done to the best of my ability. on the other hand i felt that my finish rotoscope was rather lackluster. this is due to me motion tweening too much of the finished project.</span></p>
